CPEngine:

Desc:
    Cyber Patriot scoring engine application. Will take any machine and inject vulnerabilities into the image. 
    Once the vulnerabilities are injected a scoring engine will be created to keep track of if they get patched or not.
    Will work on linux or windows.

Features:
    - standalone:
        - will provide a menu for a user to select which vulnerabilities to choose from
        - spin up a scoring engine to check every 30 seconds
        - custom vulnerabilities
        - custom forensics questions 
        - save custom config for later use

    - client/server:
        - all the same features as the standalone version
        - will also report back to a central server 
        - central server will be the same app but in a different mode
        - server should be able to handle more than one image at once via API keys
        - client should have a built in REST API to communicate to the server
        - needs to be two different modes
        - can be password protected
        - generate random Key to input into the main server


    - menu options:
        -File   
            - new engine
            - open engine config
            - save engine config
            - exit program
        - mode
            - switch between server,client and standalone
    
    - Engines will be classes that can be created that way saving them will be a breeze
        - the type of engine will be determined by the operating system (windows 10, Linux (ubuntu), or windows server)
         - win.eng
         - ubu.eng
         - srv.eng
        
    - views notes
        - main.html
            - will show recent engines that are saved
            - also a desc of the program and what notes
            - whenever the user creates a new engine the option to choose the mode will pop up until the user selects which mode to use
                - then it will direct the user to different pages 
            - uses icpmain to send the engine to the renderer
            
        - standalone
            - will give options for the standalone version of the program
        - client
            - will give options just like the standalone 
            - will also generate UID key for server interation
            - input server password
        - server
            - will show running clients
            - adding new clients via UID
            - match UID with custom names
            - setting password

    - generic notes
        - Include sample engines for each system
        - when opening a new engine or creating a new engine clear the window

    - engine notes
        - take all the score reports I can find and create a vuln for each along with a way to score it
        - talk to josh from EOC and Clark from Francis tuttle in order to try and get score reports to put in vulnerabilities
        - ability for custom vulns
        - possible be saved as formatted JSON?
        - see engTemplate.eng
        - allow users to hover over the vulnerabilities and get a description of what it does

            - policy violation: the type should be a drop down with: software, files, services
